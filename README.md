# Description
5000 ws2811 pixels all synced to Christmas Music broadcasting over a radio transmitter. Includes 8 150 pixel candy canes, 3 talking coro props, 12 vertical strips outlining the house, pixels lining both the upper and lower eaves, 3 arches, 3 misc. coro props, and more. This year, there are 6 songs and intros to go along with them. Check out the rest of the info on the first journal entry on Blueprint! https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/2889

I cannot provide the files that I used for the programming of my show, primarily for copyright reasons with the music, but also because some of my sequences were purchased, and therefore not my ip.

# History
  There is a lot to catch up on. I want to document this project in at least some detail because of how long I have been working on it. This project has taken me the better part of two years, and has been a lot of fun and work. Because Blueprint only started this October, I am only going to be logging the hours since then, even though this log will also be going into detail about everything I have done before then. I will break this project down into the sections that I have done, not necessarily in chronological order.  
  The first thing I have done is learn how to build this in the first place. I first learned about this hobby when I was really young, going to a local Christmas light show. They have since moved away, leaving me with one option: to build my own. Thankfully, my uncle who lives on the other side of the country built one himself, so he has been a big help answering any questions I have had along the way. I started by watching big light shows from people like Tom BetGeorge. Then, I went to figure out how they were done. I watched videos on YouTube from AboveChristmasLighting and How2Pixel. I found out that I needed to use Xlights to set up and plan my layout, then program it all. I spent a week or so 3D modeling my house in SketchUp (the program that I was using anyway for my architecture and engineering class), and imported it into Xlights. For year one, I had the eaves, the front window, my gate, and my garages outlined in pixels. I also had a “singing” Rudolph coro prop and some arches. Year one xlights layout: <img width="996" height="625" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/849105c6-c643-43d5-998c-c7bba9f866ae" />
  Year two layout: <img width="1345" height="633" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2f786e9-2021-4b55-b4d6-1a26cbb11072" />
  
  Next up is putting up the eaves. After a lot of research I found that the way that I wanted to do it was by drilling holes in vinyl J-channel to push pixels through. (I use exclusively WS2811 pixels). I designed and 3D printed mounts which screw into my eaves to hang the J-channel, which also allow me to slide it out of view during the Christmas season. My dad and I borrowed my grandfather’s neighbor’s drill press (won’t be the last time) to drill the holes. We then stuck the pixels through, wired it up, and hung it.  
  Another thing that I had to do was the garages and windows. My mother’s requirement for the show is that it had to have C9-style lights, which is difficult because they do not sell the type she likes with embedded smart pixels. So, I spent some time researching and designing a C9-style bulb which clips onto a WS2811 pixel. The final design is a simple revolve around a profile, 3D printed with fuzzy skin. It snaps onto a pixel, and then it is glued in place into a hole in a PVC pipe (drilled again with the drill press). Then I had to find a way to secure the PVC pipe to the house.  
  This was a great difficulty, as there was no easy preexisting way to do this. I settled on two methods: magnets and standoffs for the windows and slide-in pucks for the garages. The puck has two countersunk holes for screws to be screwed into the house. You slide in a pvc clip/holder to the puck when you need to put up the lights, then click the PVC into the clip. For the window frames, I had to get creative, as I cannot drill into these. I ended up getting some adhesive metal strips, intended for the backs of phones for magnetic car mounts, and painting them white. I then bought magnets and designed another version of my clip which has a hole in the bottom for the magnet to screw into. I also designed some standoffs with flat bottoms for most of the weight to sit on the windowsill. Now my PVC frames easily clip onto the house, both for the garages and all of the window frames.  
  I also had to have a way to control the pixels. I used the Falcon F48 and its differential receiver boards (thanks to my Uncle for gifting me that). I used 30cal ammo cans, a 12V 15A PSU, and the receiver board all in one box. The newest version of boxes that I build have four outputs of Xconnect pigtails, which are a standard to connect to all of the props I built. The boxes also have ethernet passthrough, since the receiver boards interface with the main controller board through standard ethernet cables. These boxes collectively control all of the props. I have around 8 boxes in use and 2 extras. One of my boxes has a 50A power supply and an automotive fuse block to safely control 1,200 pixels by itself (the candy canes). Additionally, I have a Raspberry Pi running Falcon Pixel Player (FPP) which is used to store the sequences and schedule them to start and stop at the right time, telling the F48 to do and when. I tell Xlights what pixel props are on what ports of the F48, then the software does the heavy lifting to render the sequences and output them to the pixels at 40fps.  
  I had to make a lot of wires to connect everything to the boxes. To make the wires, I used whatever wire I found laying around as well as some 18 3 wire I bought specifically for this project. Xconnect pigtails were soldered to the wires using 3 heat shrink solder sleeves each and some heat shrink to finish it all off. I think I had around 50 of these that had to be made, not to mention all of the spots where I had to solder the pigtails to the pixels themselves or the pixel-to-pixel connections. Making the wires was a painstaking process, especially since I had to strip every single pigtail wire as well since I bought the cheapest pigtails I could find.  
  Another thing I had to do was the Coro Props. I 3D printed myself a pixel pusher to push pixels into the high-density props without destroying my fingers. There were many props, and many pixels to push. I bought all of my props except for two from GilbertEngineeringUSA. The two that I didn’t buy, I made, since I bought 6 candy canes from them, then decided that I wanted two more to have an octave of candy canes. Those took a few days by themselves. I then had to mount the coro props. For the hanging coro props, I used PEX tubing to make a frame, then hung them from i-hooks drilled into my eaves with white paracord. The candy canes, arches, and tune-to sign use rebar hammered into the ground with PEX zip-tied to the props so that they slide onto the rebar.  
  I also had to build the verticals. I used a jig and my pixel pusher to push the pixels into megatree pixel strip, which I then mounted to the house with i-hooks and zip ties. To secure them, I used stakes in the ground, weights on the concrete, and screws into the roof.  
  There was also all of the programming. I will not go into much detail here, but I used Xlights and a bunch of community sequences (as well as some I got from my Uncle) to program the show. I recorded voiceovers of my family to give the coro props some character between songs, and programmed the lyric tracks for that as well as some of the community sequences I used. There were a few days of troubleshooting before I started up the show this year, which took a few days.  
  All in all, since October, I have made all of the wires, rebuilt most of the boxes, mounted all of the coro props/verticals, put up all of the props, 3D printed replacement bulb covers, wired up all of the props, programmed the sequences, programmed the intro, bridges, and outro, exported the sequences, made all of the hardware play nice, troubleshooted, and started up the show. In total, I have probably spent over 250 hours on this project thus far, with around 50 of those being in the past two months to get this show conpleted.
