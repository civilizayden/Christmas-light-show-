# Description
5000 ws2811 pixels all synced to Christmas Music broadcasting over a radio transmitter. Includes 8 150 pixel candy canes, 3 talking coro props, 12 vertical strips outlining the house, pixels lining both the upper and lower eaves, 3 arches, 3 misc. coro props, and more. I have built this project over two years, so there is a lot to explain. 
# Files
I made all of the 3D files in onshape. Here's the links.
